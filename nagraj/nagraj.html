        <h1>Nagraj</h1> 
	<h2>Indian Super Hero</h2> 
	<p>Nagraj is believed to have been inspired by the mythological Ichchhadhari Nag (shapeshifting snakes) and historical Vishmanushya (venomous human).</p>
	<p>His stories create a rich blend of mythology, fantasy, magic, and science fiction.</p>
	<p>Many of Nagraj's fans believe that, over time, Nagraj's comics have developed snake mythology of its own,</p> 
	<p>which is unique to the popular Indian beliefs about snakes that are prevalent among the masses.</p>
