        <h1>Shaktiman</h1> 
	<h2>Indian Super Hero</h2> 
	<p>Vehaan Arya/Shaktimaan: A young college student who works as a lab assistant to Professor Gyani at Indus City University,</p>
	<p>Vehaan wants to help himself develop a super powerful antivirus software that will ultimately destroy Kilvish for good.</p>
	<p> As his superhero alter-ego Shaktimaan, he uses his limitless superpowers to fight evil forces and save the day, apart from inspiring everyone, especially kids, to do the right thing.</p>
	<p>Shaktimaan's powers originate from five chakras (energy centers) namely Astral, Heart, Vibration, Psychic and Wisdom Chakras.</p>
	<p>The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers.</p>
